## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in cells 2-7 of the IPython notebook located in "./adLaneFinding.ipynb".

I did this in 2 steps. First run the calibration pipeline on one sample calibration image (cells 2-5) and then run it on all calibration images (cell 6-7). The steps are as follows:
* Preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  
* Prepare `imgpoints`. This will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.
* Use `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  
* Apply distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

From the calibration results, we can now apply distortion correction on any image captured by that camera. Here is an example of a test image and the undistorted version obtained using `cv2.undistort()`

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color (in the b plane of the Lab color space) and gradient thresholds (sobel X) to generate a binary image (cell 27 with the function `threshold_image()`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

P.S: First submission used the S plane of HLS colorspace that showed some issues with the shadowy areas.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warp_image()` (cell 28).  This function takes as inputs an image (`img`).  I chose to hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
apex = 460
lo = 203
lm = 585
rm = 720
ro = 1127
src = np.array([[(lm,apex), 
                 (lo,imshape[0]), 
                 (ro,imshape[0]), 
                 (rm,apex)]], dtype=np.float32)
dst = np.float32([[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
                  [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
                  [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
                  [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points. Note that the initial value of the source points were inspired from the roi calculation step in Project 1: Finding Lane Lines:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 720, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I fitted the lane lines with a second order polynomial (cell 29-30, function `fit_lanes()`). The following steps were performed:
* Threshold the warped image from the previous step. 
* Take a histogram of the bottom half of the image to see the concentration of white pixels. Use this for initial X locations of the left and right lanes.
* Check if the initial X locations are within a particular threshold (200 pixel range). If not, use the values from the prior frame.
* Do a sliding window search. Starting with the initial positions from above, move a constant sized window (margin fixed) to identify the non zero pixels in that window. These are the points that will be used to fit the polynomial.
* Use `np.polyfit()` to fit a second order polynomial for the points collected in the previous step.
* Visualize fitted line on top of the original thresholded image by generating test points and looking at the output of the fit function as shown below.

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

Then I measured the radius of curvature of the lanes (cell 31, function `measure_curvature()`). The following steps were performed:
* For the fit function, evaluate radius of curvature in pixels.
* Convert from pixel space to world coordinate system.
* Compute vehicle offset from center assuming camera placement is always at the center of the lane and image.

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

Finally, I projected back the lane area (cell 31, function `project_back()`). The following steps were performed:
* Draw a polygon on the warped coordinate system with the points used for visualizing fit.
* Perform inverse perspective transform on the image to get the area in the sensor coordinate system (front camera view).
* Add this as a layer on the undistorted non-transformed image to visualize as shown below:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

The code for this is found in cells 33-38. The function `process_image()` in cell 34 has all the essential steps that are applied to each frame in the video as follows:

* Undistort frame
* Warp to bird's eye
* Threshold to get binary lanes
* Fit lanes to 2nd order polynomial
* Measure radius of curvature of lanes
* Project lane area back on the image
* Add annotations to show curvature measurement

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

* Thresholding:
Working with thresholding is always tricky since it is challenging to find a set of thresholds that work for different conditions. Once I had a pipeline, I tested my algorithm for all the test images and adjusted thresholds so that they would work. But there were some frames in the video that were not well represented by this set of test images so I added my own to debug specifically what those issues might be. One such can be seen [here](https://github.com/sseshadr/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_report.md#4-describe-how-and-identify-where-in-your-code-you-identified-lane-line-pixels-and-fit-their-positions-with-a-polynomial). Shadows are a pretty big problem when thresholding using the S plane of HLS. I mitigated this by using a very tight window so that we rely more on the sobel based gradient threshold. Despite this you can see a huge blob in the middle of the road. This results in skewing of the lane lines and unnecessary points being introduced while performing fitting. Future directions could involve looking at other color spaces to perform thresholding that might handle shadows better.

* Perspective transform:
This is very tricky as the dependence on source and destination points is very sensitive. 

* Window searching:
The code provided in the module [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/2b62a1c3-e151-4a0e-b6b6-e424fa46ceab/lessons/40ec78ee-fb7c-4b53-94a8-028c5c60b858/concepts/c41a4b6b-9e57-44e6-9df9-7e4e74a1a49a) worked for the most part. However we search for lane lines in the full image. To avoid searching in unnecessary areas like the boundary of images, I restricted the search to between 1/4th to 3/4th of the width of the image (1/4th from the center of the car). This was fairly easy to do by looking at the histogram only selectively and improved the results remarkably.
